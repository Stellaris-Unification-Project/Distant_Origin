EMPIRE_DESIGN_mzilli_distant_origin_pasceal_desc:0 "The Pasceals evolved deep within the oceans of Xarmir, cultivating a vast aquatic civilization unknown to the Xarmiri who lived on the surface. For millennia the theocratic Pasceals were content to live beneath the waves, but when Xarmiri industries began to threaten the health of the oceans, a decision was made to intervene.\n\nPasceal warriors strode ashore and began a brutal campaign to wipe the surface-dwellers out for good. A few Xarmiri starships managed to escape the ensuing xenocide, but the rest fell to the blades and guns of the Pasceals.\n\nWith Xarmir finally tamed, and her Kingdom forever safe from outsiders, Queen Sschlass turned her attention to the stars..."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_mzilli_distant_origin_xarmiri:0 "Resurgent Xarmiri Nations"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_mzilli_distant_origin_xarmiri_desc:0 "The defining moment of Xarmiri history came two centuries ago when the $EMPIRE_DESIGN_mzilli_distant_origin_pasceal$, an aquatic civilization that ruled the ocean floor of their shared home planet, invaded the surface in response to Xarmiri industries damaging their oceans.\n\nThe result was a genocidal war, one that decimated the Xarmiri civilization and forced the survivors to flee in hastily-designed spaceships, leaving the Pasceals in total control of the planet. The refugees eventually settled on a twilight planet they dubbed \"New Xarmir\" and slowly rebuilt their species.\n\nThough not aggressive by nature, the loss of their homeworld and the stress of adapting to New Xarmir badly traumatized the Xarmiri. They will go to any length to take back their lost planet."

custom_xarmiri_start_screen:0 "We may live on this frigid planet, but make no mistake: it is §Rnot§! our home.\n\nOur race originated on Xarmir, a beautiful world of vast blue oceans and fertile island chains. We lived there in relative peace for hundreds of generations, but shortly after we split the atom, we suddenly came under attack.\n\nIt turns out there was another race on Xarmir: the Pasceals, a kingdom of molluscoids who inhabited the ocean floor. They viewed us as a threat to the health of their oceans, and saw genocide as the only acceptable solution. Billions of Xarmiri died in that great war. In the end, we had no choice but to flee in primitive starships while the Pasceals solidified their hold on the planet.\n\nWhile [capital_scope.GetName] supports us for now, we know that our story does not end here. Xarmir was our home, and it will be again. It's just a matter of time."
custom_pasceal_start_screen:0 "For as long as we Pasceals have existed, our sacred mission has remained the same: protect the balance of our homeworld's oceans, no matter the cost. Our aquatic cizilization has never wavered from that cause, despite sporadic conflict with heretics and land-dwellers.\n\nWhile we would have preferred to remain beneath the seas for all time, ultimately our mission to protect Xarmir demanded that we begin to leave it. The first space probes were launched, and then the first crewed vessels, and then the first starships. A technological renaissance began, snapping us out of the creative sterility that had held us down for millennia.\n\nWhile our current civilization bears little resemblance to the one that once lived underwater, our mission is unchanged. We will preserve Xarmir's oceans by any means necessary, and anyone who poses a threat to it will be destroyed."
