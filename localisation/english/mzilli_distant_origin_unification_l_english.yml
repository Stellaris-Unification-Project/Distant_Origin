However, in a cataclysmic event so destructive its very nature remains unknown, that great empire was brought to its knees and contact between the colonies severed permanently.\n\nWhile survival on Mars remains difficult, the inhabitants have nevertheless managed to preserve some of their cultural and technological knowledge.
